TREASURE HUNT MAZE

The player navigates through a maze/grid to find hidden treasures while avoiding traps.

Core Features:

Grid/Map:

Represented by a 2D array.

Cells can contain: empty space, treasure, trap, or exit.

Player Movement:

Controlled with arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →).

Each move updates the player’s position on the grid.

Game Rules:

Collect treasures to increase score.

If the player steps on a trap → lose points or health.

Reach the exit to win.

Scoring System:

+10 points for treasure.

-5 points for traps.

Bonus for finishing quickly (optional).

Expansion Ideas:

Add levels (increasing maze size or trap density).

Add AI enemies that move randomly (player must avoid them).

Use colors/emojis in console (like 💎 for treasure, ❌ for trap, 😀 for player).

Convert later into a GUI version using pygame (with graphics and sounds).
